# Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. 
# One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array. Find these two numbers.

# METHOD 1: CYCLIC SORT. Sort the array - if we swap a duplicate number, we return that as the dupe. Keep sorting the array til the end
    # Then we pass through the array again and see which number is out of place in the 1 indexed array. We return the number that should have been there as the missing number. 
    # Time Complexity: O(N) - cyclic sort is N, then second pass is another N. // Space complexity: O(1)
